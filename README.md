# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there is bias towards positive reviews when a reviewer is paid(Amazon vine member) when compared to a reviewer who isn't.
## Results
### Vine Reviews (Paid)
- Number of Reviews: 94
- Number of 5-star Reviews: 48
- Percentage of 5-star Reviews: 51.1%
### Non-Vine Reviews (Unpaid)
- Number of Reviews: 40,471
- Number of 5-star Reviews: 15,663
- Percentage of 5-star Reviews: 38.7%
## Summary
This data shows that there is a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program with an over 10% increase in the requency of 5-star reviews. Another analysis that I would like to perform on this data is the frequency of 1 or 2 star reviews to see if paid reviewers shy away from leaving poor reviews if a product is subpar.
